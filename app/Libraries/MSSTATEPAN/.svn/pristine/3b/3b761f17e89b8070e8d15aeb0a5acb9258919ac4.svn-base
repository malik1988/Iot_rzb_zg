First binding pair allows RFD1, RFD2 to exchange indirect messages
RFD1 (LSB= 0x70) -> RFD2 (LSB= 0x71)
RFD2 (LSB= 0x71) -> RFD1 (LSB= 0x70)


Second binding pair allows endpoint on Coordinator to exchange
indirect messages with RFD1

Coord(LSB=0x6F) -> RFD1 (LSB= 0x70)
RFD1 (LSB= 0x70) -> Coord(LSB=0x6F)
